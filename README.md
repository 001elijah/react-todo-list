# Welcome to react-rodo-list app

The app is developed upon request. The technical task was as follows:

### Task: Develop a React application incorporating a TODO list, API interaction, pagination, CRUD operations, custom design, state management through Redux or Local Storage, with optional responsive design and Docker containerization.

### Steps to Complete:

- ### Setting up the React Project:
    - Create a new React application using Create React App or any other tools of your choice.
    - Initialize a git repository and commit the changes.
- ### Fetching TODO List from an API:
    - Choose any API for retrieving a list of tasks (e.g., JSONPlaceholder).
    - Integrate the received data into the application.
- ### Implementing Pagination:
    - Implement pagination to manage the display of the task list.
    - Provide navigation between pages and display the total number of pages.
- ### CRUD Operations in TODO:
    - Implement functionality for adding, deleting, and editing tasks.
    - Update the interface accordingly when changes occur in the data.
- ### Custom Design:
    - Create a design for the TODO list and control elements.
    - Use styling with CSS or any tool of your choice.
- ### State Management via Redux or Local Storage:
    - Decide whether to use global state management through Redux or local state through Local Storage.
    - Implement the saving of task state according to the chosen approach.
- ### Additional Options (Optional):
    - Implement responsive design for proper display on different devices.
- ### Project Documentation:
    - ### Installation and Launch:
        - Provide instructions for installing dependencies and launching the project.
    - ### Repository Link:
        - Provide a link to the git repository containing the complete project code.
    - ### Notes:
        - Code should be well-structured and accompanied by comments.
        - Documentation can be presented as a README.md file in the root of the repository.
